## 🙋‍♀️ Who are we?

We are a [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/) based in the Tri-Cities area of Metro Vancouver, British Columbia. We are committed to teaching middle- and high-school students programming through fun workshops, and by participating in YSWS (You Ship -> We Ship) programs from Hack Club, such as [Boba Drops](https://boba.hackclub.com/).
